# We serialise mod_qos managed requests, i.e. data requests.  This means
# mod_qos will process requests from the same source IP one at a time,
# queueing others for up to 5 minutes.  After 5 minutes queued requests
# are released for processing.

QS_ClientSerialize       On

# limit the total number of concurrent mod_qos managed requests from
# a single IP address.  The limit is pretty low because we can have
# single request taking 2 minutes to execute and using up a full CPU
# on the triple store while it does that.  We have 8 CPUs available.
# Limiting the current requests to 6, given that serialisation is also
# on means that we can get at most 5 queries  executing at the same time
# from a single IP address.  That could be 60% of the available computer
# power.  About half the time it is a lot less than that.  Note that
# there are at least 2 servers and this limit applies
# to each server independently, so there can be up to 10 requests from
# from a single source IP executing at the same time and a further 2
# waiting in the queue

# With this configuration if a single rogue source dumps a high rate
# of expensive queries at the service it should not get swamped.
# The load will go up but there should be sufficient capacity
