  ## When local is true (the default), the node will read only its own stats.
  ## Set local to false when you want to read the node stats from all nodes
  ## of the cluster.
  local = true

  ## Set cluster_health to true when you want to obtain cluster health stats
  cluster_health = true

  ## Adjust cluster_health_level when you want to obtain detailed health stats
  ## The options are
  ##  - indices (default)
  ##  - cluster
  # cluster_health_level = "indices"

  ## Set cluster_stats to true when you want to obtain cluster stats.
  cluster_stats = true

  ## Only gather cluster_stats from the master node. To work this require local = true
  cluster_stats_only_from_master = true

  ## Indices to collect; can be one or more indices names or _all
  indices_include = ["_all"]

  ## One of "shards", "cluster", "indices"
  ## Currently only "shards" is implemented
